# Philosophers Project üçΩÔ∏è
The Philosophers project at 42 School involves **simulating the classic dining philosophers** problem to explore concepts in concurrency and synchronization. üß†

The program is designed to demonstrate how philosophers (represented as threads) behave when sharing resources (forks). 
The main goal is to **understand and manage synchronization issues**, such as **avoiding deadlocks** and ensuring that all philosophers get a chance to eat.

This project enhances our understanding of thread management, synchronization techniques, and concurrent programming.

## Features üìã
1. **Thread Management:** Create and manage multiple threads representing philosophers.
2. **Synchronization:** Use mutexes and semaphores to handle resource sharing and avoid deadlocks.
3. **Concurrency:** Implement concurrent behaviors and ensure proper synchronization.

## Objectives üéØ
1. Master thread management and concurrency concepts.
2. Develop robust synchronization techniques.
3. Improve understanding of concurrent programming.

## Usage üìú
You need to provide several arguments when running the program to specify the simulation parameters:
**Number of Philosophers**: Specifies how many philosophers (threads) will be involved in the simulation.

**Time to Die**: The time (in milliseconds) a philosopher can go without eating before dying. This simulates the maximum time a philosopher can spend without acquiring both forks.

**Time to Eat**: The time (in milliseconds) it takes for a philosopher to eat once they have both forks.

**Time to Sleep**: The time (in milliseconds) a philosopher spends sleeping after eating. During this time, the philosopher is not attempting to acquire forks.

**Number of Meals:**(Optional): The number of times each philosopher should eat before the simulation ends. If not specified, philosophers will continue eating and sleeping indefinitely.

The simulation **prints messages** to the console to indicate the actions of the philosophers. Each message is formatted as follows:
[timestamp] Philosopher ID: action

[timestamp]: The elapsed time (in milliseconds) since the simulation started.

Philosopher ID: The unique identifier of the philosopher performing the action.

action: The action being performed by the philosopher, such as: is thinking, is eating, is sleeping, has taken a fork, is dead
